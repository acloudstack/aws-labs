 - Provide you with tools and open-source software that you can adapt and improve in your environment
---

## Security in Cloud 
- Bigest threats today: 
  - DDoS: HTTP Flood, Abusive Users (Solution: Volumetric Detection method)
  - OWASP Top 10: SQL Injection, XSS, Application Exploits
  - Bad Bots: Crawlers, Content Scrapers, Scanners & probes (Solution: Filterring Method)
- How to detect, block, filter, monitor and tuning
---
## AWS WAF Intro
Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a fully managed service from AWS, that gives you control over who or what can access your Web Application
- Protects against exploits, abuses and application DDoS
- Helps find and block the bad requests.
- Provides visibility tools to see what kinds of requests are hitting the website and a flexible rule language to block bad requests
- Full featured API
- Customizable Security
- Integration with Cloudfront, ALB and API Gateway 

---

## AWS Lambda Intro
AWS Lambda automatically run your code without provisioning server
- Serverless, event-driven 
- Integrated with other AWS Services
- Support for most of the modern programming languages

---

## Security Automation

- A traditional security model tends to make heavy use of set and forget rules.  These rules are an effective mitigation technique but static rules don't always keep up with the shifting pattern of attackers. Automation can detect and adapt to shifting patterns of attackers.
- For better protection and improve the security response, more and more customers are finding the need to integrate data from other parts of their application. For example, customers in the financial services industry may pair web log data with banking transaction data to identify fraudulent activity and block bad actors right at the front of their website.
